   We introduce a monotone deep equilibrium learning framework for large-scale
   inverse problems in imaging. The proposed algorithm relies on
   forward-backward splitting, where each iteration consists of a gradient descent
   involving the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm to encourage data
   consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural
   network. The use of a monotone operator offers several benefits, including
   guaranteed convergence, uniqueness of fixed point, and robustness to input
   perturbations, similar to the use of convex priors in compressive sensing. In
   addition, the proposed formulation is significantly more memory-efficient than
   unrolled methods, which allows us to apply it to 3D problems that current unrolled
   algorithms cannot handle. Experiments show that the proposed scheme can offer
   improved performance in 3D settings while being stable in the presence of input
   perturbations.

   Model-based deep learning (MoDL) algorithms that rely on unrolling are emerging as powerful tools for image recovery.
   In this work, we introduce a novel monotone operator learning framework to overcome
   some of the challenges associated with current unrolled frameworks, including high
   memory cost, lack of guarantees on robustness to perturbations, and low
   interpretability. Unlike current unrolled architectures that use finite number of
   iterations, we use the deep equilibrium (DEQ) framework to iterate the algorithm
   to convergence and to evaluate the gradient of the convolutional neural network
   blocks using Jacobian iterations. This approach significantly reduces the memory
   demand, facilitating the extension of MoDL algorithms to high dimensional problems.
   We constrain the CNN to be a monotone operator, which allows us to introduce
   algorithms with guaranteed convergence properties and robustness guarantees.
   We demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme in the context of parallel MRI.

   Image reconstruction using deep learning algorithms offers improved reconstruction quality and lower
   reconstruction time than classical compressed sensing and model-based algorithms. Unfortunately, clean and
   fully sampled ground-truth data to train the deep networks is often not available in several applications,
   restricting the applicability of the above methods. This work introduces the ENsemble Stein's Unbiased Risk
   Estimate (ENSURE) framework as a general approach to train deep image reconstruction algorithms without fully
   sampled and noise-free images. The proposed framework is the generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE
   formulation to the setting where the images are sampled by different measurement operators, chosen randomly
   from a set. We show that the ENSURE loss function, which only uses the measurement data, is an unbiased
   estimate for the true mean-square error. Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss
   function can offer reconstructions comparable to the supervised setting. While we demonstrate this framework
   in the context of MR image recovery, the ENSURE framework is generally applicable to arbitrary inverse problems.

   Deep learning algorithms are emerging as powerful alternatives to compressed sensing
   methods, offering improved image quality and computational efficiency. Unfortunately,
   fully sampled training images may not be available or are difficult to acquire in
   several applications, including high-resolution and dynamic imaging. Previous studies
   in image reconstruction have utilized Stein&#39s Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) as a
   mean square error (MSE) estimate for the image denoising step in an unrolled network.
   Unfortunately, the end-to-end training of a network using SURE remains challenging
   since the projected SURE loss is a poor approximation to the MSE, especially in the
   heavily undersampled setting. We propose an ENsemble SURE (ENSURE) approach to train
   a deep network only from undersampled measurements. In particular, we show that
   training a network using an ensemble of images, each acquired with a different
   sampling pattern, can closely approximate the MSE. Our preliminary experimental
   results show that the proposed ENSURE approach gives comparable reconstruction
   quality to supervised learning and a recent unsupervised learning method.

   The volume estimation of brain regions from MRI data is a key problem in many
   clinical applications, where the acquisition of data at high spatial resolution is
   desirable. While parallel MRI and constrained image reconstruction algorithms can
   accelerate the scans, image reconstruction artifacts are inevitable, especially at
   high acceleration factors. We introduce a novel image domain deep-learning
   framework for calibrationless parallel MRI reconstruction, coupled with a
   segmentation network to improve image quality and to reduce the vulnerability of
   current segmentation algorithms to image artifacts resulting from acceleration.
   The combination of the proposed image domain deep calibrationless approach with the
   segmentation algorithm offers improved image quality, while increasing the accuracy
   of the segmentations. The novel architecture with an encoder shared between the
   reconstruction and segmentation tasks is seen to reduce the need for segmented
   training datasets. In particular, the proposed few-shot training strategy requires
   only 10% of segmented datasets to offer good performance.

   The main focus of this work is a novel framework for the joint reconstruction and segmentation of parallel
   MRI (PMRI) brain data. We introduce an image domain deep network for calibrationless recovery of undersampled
   PMRI data. The proposed approach is the deep-learning (DL) based generalization of local low-rank based
   approaches for uncalibrated PMRI recovery including CLEAR [6]. Since the image domain approach exploits
   additional annihilation relations compared to k-space based approaches, we expect it to offer improved
   performance. To minimize segmentation errors resulting from undersampling artifacts, we combined the proposed
   scheme with a segmentation network and trained it in an end-to-end fashion. In addition to reducing segmentation
   errors, this approach also offers improved reconstruction performance by reducing overfitting; the reconstructed
   images exhibit reduced blurring and sharper edges than independently trained reconstruction network.

<div id="myDropdown6" class="dropdown-content-abstract">
   Structured low-rank (SLR) algorithms, which exploit annihilation relations between the Fourier
   samples of a signal resulting from different properties, is a powerful image reconstruction
   framework in several applications. This scheme relies on low-rank matrix completion to estimate
   the annihilation relations from the measurements. The main challenge with this strategy is the high
   computational complexity of matrix completion. We introduce a deep learning (DL) approach to
   significantly reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural
   network (CNN)-based filterbank that is trained to estimate the annihilation relations from
   imperfect (under-sampled and noisy) k-space measurements of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The
   main reason for the computational efficiency is the pre-learning of the parameters of the non-linear
   CNN from exemplar data, compared to SLR schemes that learn the linear filterbank parameters from
   the dataset itself. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed scheme can enable
   calibration-less parallel MRI; it can offer performance similar to SLR schemes while reducing the
   runtime by around three orders of magnitude. Unlike pre-calibrated and self-calibrated approaches,
   the proposed uncalibrated approach is insensitive to motion errors and affords higher acceleration.
   The proposed scheme also incorporates image domain priors that are complementary, thus
   significantly improving the performance over that of SLR schemes.
